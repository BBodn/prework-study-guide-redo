# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was developed for the sole purpose of archiving notes taken from the Fullstack Development Bootcamp hosted by the University of Utah. While developing this webpage, I learned how to utilize HTML & CSS effectively to create visuals, as well as how JavaScript can bring functionality to the webpage.

## Installation
N/A.

## Usage
The sole purpose of this webpage is to act like a virtual notebook, one that can be changed and altered to fit each individuals' unique needs. From the index.html, you can create notes for each of the provided topics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git) or use them as a template for different topics. You can also change the colors and styles from within style.css. Finally, script.js provides functionality so be sure to use that for any interactivity you may wish to implement.
